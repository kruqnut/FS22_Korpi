FINNISH WEATHER

I edited environment.xml file to simulate the weather in Finland (or Skandinavia).

Following things have been done:
-temperatures
-chance for sunny/cloudy/rainy weather
-now there is a small chance of snowing in the spring and autumn
-wind speed and direction
-duration of the rain etc.
-drop scales (minor changes)


Note!
-This is not a normal mod, you have to overwrite an existing .xml file in the map folder or in the mods .zip file
-Always make a backup of the file you'll replace with this.

Installation:
-Go to the map-folder you want to change; for example: D:\Farming Simulator 2022\data\maps\mapUS
-rename the environment.xml to default_environment.xml (or make a backup elsewhere)
-copy and paste my environment.xml file to the same  map folder

-if you want to change the weather in a custom map, go to your mods folder for example: C:\Users\John Doe\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2022\mods and open the mod file (like FS22_Kuusela.zip)
-open the map folder and add my environment.xml file
